This project explores Spotify user behavior to identify potential **churn patterns** (subscription cancellations).  
It includes two main components:  

1. An **interactive dashboard** with key insights.  
2. A **Jupyter Notebook** (`src/spotify_churn_analysis.ipynb`) containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, predictive models, and conclusions.
